##Tech stack

- Google Contacts API
- Github API

##Problem statement

It's slow and boring to look for relevant (and available) freelancing friends when we want to forward a mission to them

##Pitch

A personal directory in which I can add my freelance friends, look for relevant ones based on technologies, and subscribe to their updates of skills, preferences and availability (in order to update my directory)

##Use cases

- Find relevant and available Freelancers quickly from your contacts, based on the stack/skills of the mission that you want to forward
- Edit the technical stack / skills, preferences, and availability of your Freelancing contacts, manually
- Subscribe to your Freelancing contacts, to help you update their info (i.e. stack/skills, prefs, avail.)
- As a Freelancer, publish your updates (i.e. stack/skills, prefs, avail.), so that your friends can integrate changes into their directory
